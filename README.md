# PDF-chatbot by **Ch. Manoj Naga Varma**

This project concerns a chatbot designed to interact with the content in desired PDF files. It is like asking answers to questions that are from the content.

This project uses the Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM Model and is built using Google API Studio API.

Due to our limited resources and budget, we are using a free Google API, which can be accessed only once by a single user at the same time.
